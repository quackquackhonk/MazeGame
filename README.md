# MazeGame
I like mazes so this will be fun

I'm going to make a maze application that will allow for the generation of random mazes using different maze generation algorithms.

The application will also be able to solve any given maze using different maze solving algorithms.

Both of these functions will be capable of being run immediately or by going through each step and showing the process of the algorithms.

I'm really doing this for fun lmao
