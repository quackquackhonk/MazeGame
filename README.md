# MazeGame

Run main.py to start the program. (Needs python3 and pygame)

CONTROLS:
    - 'r' resets the maze
    - 'space' generates the maze instantly
    - 'g' enables slowGen, and allow you to watch the maze generate in real time
    - Arrow keys control the player

I like mazes so this will be fun

I'm going to make a maze application that will allow for the generation of random mazes using different maze generation algorithms.

The application will also be able to solve any given maze using different maze solving algorithms.

Both of these functions will be capable of being run immediately or by going through each step and showing the process of the algorithms.

I'm really doing this for fun lmao
